# How To Run
If you are doing this on intellij:

Open the project as a "Maven Project"

Add a configuration for "Application": The "coms362.cards.webapp.Bootstrap" file is what should be used for the "main class".

After running the project, go to "http://localhost:8080/cards362/?host&player=1&min=2&max=4&game=PU52MP"

Then open another tab and go to "http://localhost:8080/cards362/?player=2"
